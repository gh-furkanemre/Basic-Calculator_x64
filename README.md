--About Me--
I'm currently learning C++, and this project serves as my practice. I would be happy if someone finds my project useful or enjoyable. 
It took me 1/2 days to complete.

--Basic Calculator Project--
This calculator supports four fundamental operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
It's a simple calculator that works with only two numbers at a time. 
The application has been developed using C++ and C++ Windows Form. Please note: This project is designed for "Windows" platforms.
It's compatible with x64 processes.
Interaction is limited to mouse clicks.

--Running the Application--
Open the "Hesap_Makinesi.sln" folder.
Run it in either debug or release mode.

--Making Changes--
Feel free to modify or review the code in the "MyForm.h" design or "MyForm.h" code files as per your requirements.

--License--
This project does not have a specific license.
